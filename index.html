              CCS is a department of the University of Guelph which handles the technology infrastructure of the entire university campus. This includes a wide variety of services, such as the campus-wide internet, server hosting, student and staff email, software distribution, IT support and much more. I worked with the CCS Help Centre which is made up of a student team and full-time staff. I worked with the student team alongside 3 other co-op students and the part-time student workers. The student team was in charge of looking over the Help Centre queue, handling incoming calls to the Help Centre, and providing in-person support at the CCS IT Help Desk. <br><br>The Help Centre was a great place to work at. I had an amazing supervisor, who was very welcoming and did a great job guiding us through the ins and outs of the Help centre. Furthermore, since I was working with other students, it was easy to communicate with one another and work as a team.</p>

          <p>CCS is made up of several teams that manage the various area of IT support at the University of Guelph. I worked alongside the student team at the CCS Help Centre. The Help Centre acts as the first point of contact between clients and any CCS service. When clients need various types of IT support, the Help Centre is the people who handle client emails, phone calls and offer in-person support. <br><br>This is done in two places, the Help Centre in the basement of Johnston Hall and at the IT Help Desk in the Library. At the Help Centre, the student team is tasked with managing all incoming calls to the Help Centre extension and handling all tickets in our ticketing queue. Tickets are mainly emails sent in from students and staff to the Help Centre email. However, tickets also get generated from forms and can be assigned to us by other teams in CCS. These tickets are either assigned to the various teams at CCS or a member of the student team will communicate with the client until the ticket can be closed. Calls worked in a similar fashion, where the student team member would talk to the client and try to resolve an issue with the client over the phone and if it couldn't be resolved a ticket would be made and escalated to the appropriate team.<br><br>At the Help Desk, the student team helped clients in person. We would mostly deal with clients and the technical issue they were having with their phones, laptops, tablets, etc. This revolved around helping to install software, diagnosing/fixing issues with a clients device, helping them connect to the internet, emails issues, etc. Also, we would get clients that were having issues with there University of Guelph accounts.

          <h2 class="mb-5">Goals</h2>
          <p> <img src="img/comm.jpg" alt="" style="width:320px;margin: 0px 20px;" align="left"> My main goal on this work term was to strengthen my oral and written communication skills. Due to the nature of this job, I spent most of my time communicating with clients and when I first started my work term, I struggled with getting information from the client, was really awkward, and didn't know how to end or start conversations. To improve this skill I answered phone calls and simply allowed the client to speak and tried to understand their problem. If something didn't make sense I asked questions to help clarify, and then repeated what their issue was to make sure I fully understood the client. This proved to be successful because near the end of my work term the client rarely corrected my assumption of their problem. Also, on the various survey responses, I got back, I have complimented on my polite nature and my ability to solve there issue quickly.<br><br>Having now completed this work term, I can see a drastic change in my approach and ability to communicate. I now can deal with clients with a lot of confidence, easily explain information to a client and understand what they are saying. I feel this skill will help me throughout my career and allow me to interact with users/coworkers in a positive manner while maintaining a professional demeanour. It has also helped develop my ability to explain a technical process in layman's terms.<br><br> <img src="img/inquiry.jpg" alt="" style="width:320px;margin: 0px 20px;" align="right"> Another goal I had on this work term was getting better at finding out what the client's problem is, and what might be causing it. Since the clients did not have technical knowledge, they didn't explain their problem using the correct terminology, so I had to get better at reading between the lines. I did this by asking simple questions, that helped me get the details I need. Had a reserve of quick solutions, which were things that typically solved the problem (for example, clear cookies and cache). When I really didn't know what the client problem was, I put them on hold and either asked my coworkers/supervisor or did some research to understand what the client was explaining. <br><br>This goal truly tested me as this is was a constant occurrence in the help centre. Generally, our clients don't know what they are talking about and therefore entails a lot of information gathering to really find out what they need to resolve their issue. I have become much better at this and no longer even hesitate to ask for help from my coworkers. Furthermore, this was a skill worth improving because I will be working with users who don't have the same technical knowledge as me. I need to be able to analysis and inquire information in non-technical terms that the user with understand

          <h2 class="mb-5">Conclusions</h2>
          <p>I am very grateful that I had the opportunity to do my first co-op term at the CCS Help Centre. Working with Help Centre, I learned a lot about interacting with end users and was able to strengthen so many of my soft skills. Although there were not many opportunities to apply my coding skill or many of the software methodologies learned in school, there were still many things I experienced working here that I would never have had the chance to otherwise. For future work terms, I will look to find a more technical job that will allow me to use the skills I am learning in school in tandem with all the soft skills I developed on this work term. In the I could not have asked for a better first work term, that resulted in a guaranteed part-time job while I study at the University of Guelph. </p>

          <p>I would like to thank the Help Centre supervisor, Jill Hogg for being the best supervisor I will ever have. I have been extremely lucky to have a supervisor who was so caring, understanding and who has provided amazing guidance throughout my work term.<br><br>My special thanks are extended to the full-time staff, who worked alongside the Help Centre, they're guidance was invaluable.<br><br>I am very grateful to the student team, I would not have enjoyed this work term had it not been for all the new friends I made working alongside them. I want to thank them for doing all those tickets I didn't want to handle and laughing at all my bad jokes :)<br><br>I want to thank the SOCS coop team for all the help and support during, before and after my co-op term. Also thanks to Greg Koltz!</p>
