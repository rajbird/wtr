              The Co-operators are a Canadian insurance and financial services co-operative. They work in three areas: Property and Casualty insurance, Life insurance and institutional investments. They support about 5000 employee and work hard at creating a sustainable society.<br><br>At the Co-operators, I worked on the Technical Platform Support (TPS) Team, providing second level support to their employees. This team was the base of tech support at the Co-operators. The team interacted heavily with Co-operator’s employees and the various other teams to provide technical support. The team was compromised of roughly 25+ individuals, who worked across Canada in Regina, Moncton, Mississauga, Burlington, and Guelph (I worked in the Guelph office).<br><br>TPS was a great team to work with. The team was very friendly and made me feel like I was a part of their team from day one. They did a tremendous job guiding me through my role and were very approachable for question asking

          <p>TPS monitors and responds to problem tickets created by first level Help Desk support, internal teams, and self-serve tickets created by employees. The tickets are sent to two separate queue, an unassigned tickets queue, and a self serve ticket queue. These tickets include hardware and software problems reported by a large group of users across multiple geographic locations. My main job as a Technical Support Analyst was to take incidents are resolve them. This meant performing basic troubleshooting, diagnosis, and root-cause analysis, to figure out how to solve a ticket. Since, users submitted tickets from various geographical locations, this required the TPS team members to work in shifts. The shifts spanned a week, and were divided in to 4 types of shifts; early shift (7:00 AM – 3:30 PM), late Shift (9:00 AM – 5:30 PM and 9:30 AM – 6:00 PM), regular shift (8:30 AM – 5:00 PM), self-serve shift (8:00 AM – 4:30 PM). Each shift had specified responsibilities, that needed to be completed while you were working that shift.<br><br>TPS had a knowledge bases full of articles that provided instructions on common issue/errors and articles around Co-operators polices. Another aspect of the jab was helping maintain this knowledge bases. By constantly attaching knowledge articles to tickets, and creating and maintaining knowledge articles for new and existing known errors utilizing standard enterprise tools and processes. Since, I was a co-op student, I didn’t have to learn how to approve knowledge articles when they were submitted by other team members.<br><br>While I was there, I was asked to create an application that would automate the creation of a virus report. This report gets created every month to keep track of how many virus-related tickets the team handles, what types of virus are being found on computers, and track sites that virus are being downloaded from. The data for the report comes from various different places, I used PowerShell to</p>

            My job revolved around resolving tickets, hence my main goal on this co-op term was to be a top ticket taker. When I started at the job there was a lot to learn and familiarize myself with. This meant there were certain tickets I struggled with, since the issue the users was having focused on areas I didn’t have experience in. But I tried to take a variety of tickets, to force my self to learn about the software’s the Co-operators employees were using and to familiarize myself with how to handle hardware issues. Doing this helped expose me to the team’s knowledges bases, where I was able to find documentation that helped guide me through solving tickets. The first two months on the job, I got into a pattern and figured out the best way for me to take and solve tickets. Then by my third month on the job I was able to meet my goal and become the top ticket taker on the team. By the end of my work term, I had taken the most tickets during my four months on the team. Taking so many tickets, improved my time management and multitasking skills, as I had to juggle up to 20 tickets a day. <br><br>Another goal I had on this work term was getting better at finding out what the client's problem is, and what might be causing it. Since the clients did not have technical knowledge, they didn't explain their problem using the correct terminology and rarely provided enough information, so I had to get better at reading between the lines. I did this by first figuring out what product was causing the client issues, and if any knowledge or past tickets existed to help start the troubleshooting process. If past information wasn't enough to solve the clients issue, I gathered more information on the clients issue and asked my mentor/the Team for help or I some research for a potential solution.<br><br>This goal truly tested me as this is was a constant occurrence with self-serve tickets coming in. Generally, our clients don't know what they are talking about and therefore entails a lot of information gathering to really find out what they need to resolve their issue. I have become much better at this and no longer even hesitate to ask for help from my coworkers. Furthermore, this was a skill worth improving because I will be working with users who don't have the same technical knowledge as me. I need to be able to analysis and inquire information in non-technical terms that the user will understand.

          <h2 class="mb-5">Conclusions</h2>
          <p>I am very grateful that I had the opportunity to do my third co-op term at the Co-operators. Working in TPS, I learned a lot about interacting with end users and was able to strengthen so many of my soft skills. Although there were not many opportunities to apply my coding skill or many of the software methodologies learned in school, there were still many things I experienced working here that I would never have had the chance to otherwise. For future work terms, I will look to find a more technical job that will allow me to use the skills I am learning in school in tandem with all the soft skills I developed on this work term. </p>
