The Help Centre acts as the first point of contact between clients and any CCS service.

At the Help Centre, the student team is tasked with managing all incoming calls to the Help Centre extension and handling all tickets in our ticketing queue. Tickets are mainly emails sent in from students and staff to the Help Centre email. However, tickets also get generated from forms and can be assigned to us by other teams in CCS. These tickets are either assigned to the various teams at CCS or a member of the student team will communicate with the client until the ticket can be closed. Calls worked in a similar fashion, where the student team member would talk to the client and try to resolve an issue with the client over the phone and if it couldn't be resolved a ticket would be made and escalated to the appropriate team.<br><br>At the Help Desk, the student team helped clients in person. We would mostly deal with clients and the technical issue they were having with their phones, laptops, tablets, etc. This revolved around helping to install software, diagnosing/fixing issues with a clients device, helping them connect to the internet, emails issues, etc. Also, we would get clients that were having issues with there University of Guelph accounts.

          <h2 class="mb-5">Goals</h2>
          <p> <img src="img/comm.jpg" alt="" style="width:320px;margin: 0px 20px;" align="left"> My main goal on this work term was to strengthen my oral and written communication skills. Due to the nature of this job, I spent most of my time communicating with clients and when I first started my work term, I struggled with getting information from the client, was really awkward, and didn't know how to end or start conversations. To improve this skill I answered phone calls and simply allowed the client to speak and tried to understand their problem. If something didn't make sense I asked questions to help clarify, and then repeated what their issue was to make sure I fully understood the client. This proved to be successful because near the end of my work term the client rarely corrected my assumption of their problem. Also, on the various survey responses, I got back, I have complimented on my polite nature and my ability to solve there issue quickly.<br><br>Having now completed this work term, I can see a drastic change in my approach and ability to communicate. I now can deal with clients with a lot of confidence, easily explain information to a client and understand what they are saying. I feel this skill will help me throughout my career and allow me to interact with users/coworkers in a positive manner while maintaining a professional demeanour. It has also helped develop my ability to explain a technical process in layman's terms.<br><br> <img src="img/inquiry.jpg" alt="" style="width:320px;margin: 0px 20px;" align="right"> Another goal I had on this work term was getting better at finding out what the client's problem is, and what might be causing it. Since the clients did not have technical knowledge, they didn't explain their problem using the correct terminology, so I had to get better at reading between the lines. I did this by asking simple questions, that helped me get the details I need. Had a reserve of quick solutions, which were things that typically solved the problem (for example, clear cookies and cache). When I really didn't know what the client problem was, I put them on hold and either asked my coworkers/supervisor or did some research to understand what the client was explaining. <br><br>This goal truly tested me as this is was a constant occurrence in the help centre. Generally, our clients don't know what they are talking about and therefore entails a lot of information gathering to really find out what they need to resolve their issue. I have become much better at this and no longer even hesitate to ask for help from my coworkers. Furthermore, this was a skill worth improving because I will be working with users who don't have the same technical knowledge as me. I need to be able to analysis and inquire information in non-technical terms that the user with understand

          <h2 class="mb-5">Conclusions</h2>
          <p>I am very grateful that I had the opportunity to do my first co-op term at the CCS Help Centre. Working with Help Centre, I learned a lot about interacting with end users and was able to strengthen so many of my soft skills. Although there were not many opportunities to apply my coding skill or many of the software methodologies learned in school, there were still many things I experienced working here that I would never have had the chance to otherwise. For future work terms, I will look to find a more technical job that will allow me to use the skills I am learning in school in tandem with all the soft skills I developed on this work term. In the I could not have asked for a better first work term, that resulted in a guaranteed part-time job while I study at the University of Guelph. </p>

This team was the base of tech support at the Co-operators. The team interacted heavily with Co-operator’s employees and the various other teams to provide technical support. The team was compromised of roughly 25+ individuals, who worked across Canada in Regina, Moncton, Mississauga, Burlington, and Guelph (I worked in the Guelph office).<br><br>TPS was a great team to work with.

          <h2 class="mb-5">Job Description</h2>
          <p>TPS monitors and responds to problem tickets created by first level Help Desk support, internal teams, and self-serve tickets created by employees. The tickets are sent to two separate queue, an unassigned tickets queue, and a self serve ticket queue. These tickets include hardware and software problems reported by a large group of users across multiple geographic locations. My main job as a Technical Support Analyst was to take incidents are resolve them. This meant performing basic troubleshooting, diagnosis, and root-cause analysis, to figure out how to solve a ticket. Since, users submitted tickets from various geographical locations, this required the TPS team members to work in shifts. The shifts spanned a week, and were divided in to 4 types of shifts; early shift (7:00 AM – 3:30 PM), late Shift (9:00 AM – 5:30 PM and 9:30 AM – 6:00 PM), regular shift (8:30 AM – 5:00 PM), self-serve shift (8:00 AM – 4:30 PM). Each shift had specified responsibilities, that needed to be completed while you were working that shift.<br><br>TPS had a knowledge bases full of articles that provided instructions on common issue/errors and articles around Co-operators polices. Another aspect of the jab was helping maintain this knowledge bases. By constantly attaching knowledge articles to tickets, and creating and maintaining knowledge articles for new and existing known errors utilizing standard enterprise tools and processes. Since, I was a co-op student, I didn’t have to learn how to approve knowledge articles when they were submitted by other team members.<br><br>While I was there, I was asked to create an application that would automate the creation of a virus report. This report gets created every month to keep track of how many virus-related tickets the team handles, what types of virus are being found on computers, and track sites that virus are being downloaded from. The data for the report comes from various different places, I used PowerShell to</p>

            My job revolved around resolving tickets, hence my main goal on this co-op term was to be a top ticket taker. When I started at the job there was a lot to learn and familiarize myself with. This meant there were certain tickets I struggled with, since the issue the users was having focused on areas I didn’t have experience in. But I tried to take a variety of tickets, to force my self to learn about the software’s the Co-operators employees were using and to familiarize myself with how to handle hardware issues. Doing this helped expose me to the team’s knowledges bases, where I was able to find documentation that helped guide me through solving tickets. The first two months on the job, I got into a pattern and figured out the best way for me to take and solve tickets. Then by my third month on the job I was able to meet my goal and become the top ticket taker on the team. By the end of my work term, I had taken the most tickets during my four months on the team. Taking so many tickets, improved my time management and multitasking skills, as I had to juggle up to 20 tickets a day. <br><br>Another goal I had on this work term was getting better at finding out what the client's problem is, and what might be causing it. Since the clients did not have technical knowledge, they didn't explain their problem using the correct terminology and rarely provided enough information, so I had to get better at reading between the lines. I did this by first figuring out what product was causing the client issues, and if any knowledge or past tickets existed to help start the troubleshooting process. If past information wasn't enough to solve the clients issue, I gathered more information on the clients issue and asked my mentor/the Team for help or I some research for a potential solution.<br><br>This goal truly tested me as this is was a constant occurrence with self-serve tickets coming in. Generally, our clients don't know what they are talking about and therefore entails a lot of information gathering to really find out what they need to resolve their issue. I have become much better at this and no longer even hesitate to ask for help from my coworkers. Furthermore, this was a skill worth improving because I will be working with users who don't have the same technical knowledge as me. I need to be able to analysis and inquire information in non-technical terms that the user will understand.
