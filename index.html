These tickets are either assigned to the various teams at CCS or a member of the student team will communicate with the client until the ticket can be closed. Calls worked in a similar fashion, where the student team member would talk to the client and try to resolve an issue with the client over the phone and if it couldn't be resolved a ticket would be made and escalated to the appropriate team.<br><br>At the Help Desk, the student team helped clients in person. We would mostly deal with clients and the technical issue they were having with their phones, laptops, tablets, etc. This revolved around helping to install software, diagnosing/fixing issues with a clients device, helping them connect to the internet, emails issues, etc. Also, we would get clients that were having issues with there University of Guelph accounts.

          <p> <img src="img/comm.jpg" alt="" style="width:320px;margin: 0px 20px;" align="left"> My main goal on this work term was to strengthen my oral and written communication skills. Due to the nature of this job, I spent most of my time communicating with clients and when I first started my work term, I struggled with getting information from the client, was really awkward, and didn't know how to end or start conversations. To improve this skill I answered phone calls and simply allowed the client to speak and tried to understand their problem. If something didn't make sense I asked questions to help clarify, and then repeated what their issue was to make sure I fully understood the client. This proved to be successful because near the end of my work term the client rarely corrected my assumption of their problem. Also, on the various survey responses, I got back, I have complimented on my polite nature and my ability to solve there issue quickly.<br><br>Having now completed this work term, I can see a drastic change in my approach and ability to communicate. I now can deal with clients with a lot of confidence, easily explain information to a client and understand what they are saying. I feel this skill will help me throughout my career and allow me to interact with users/coworkers in a positive manner while maintaining a professional demeanour. It has also helped develop my ability to explain a technical process in layman's terms.<br><br> <img src="img/inquiry.jpg" alt="" style="width:320px;margin: 0px 20px;" align="right"> Another goal I had on this work term was getting better at finding out what the client's problem is, and what might be causing it. Since the clients did not have technical knowledge, they didn't explain their problem using the correct terminology, so I had to get better at reading between the lines. I did this by asking simple questions, that helped me get the details I need. Had a reserve of quick solutions, which were things that typically solved the problem (for example, clear cookies and cache). When I really didn't know what the client problem was, I put them on hold and either asked my coworkers/supervisor or did some research to understand what the client was explaining. <br><br>This goal truly tested me as this is was a constant occurrence in the help centre. Generally, our clients don't know what they are talking about and therefore entails a lot of information gathering to really find out what they need to resolve their issue. I have become much better at this and no longer even hesitate to ask for help from my coworkers. Furthermore, this was a skill worth improving because I will be working with users who don't have the same technical knowledge as me. I need to be able to analysis and inquire information in non-technical terms that the user with understand

          <h2 class="mb-5">Conclusions</h2>
          <p>I am very grateful that I had the opportunity to do my first co-op term at the CCS Help Centre. Working with Help Centre, I learned a lot about interacting with end users and was able to strengthen so many of my soft skills. Although there were not many opportunities to apply my coding skill or many of the software methodologies learned in school, there were still many things I experienced working here that I would never have had the chance to otherwise. For future work terms, I will look to find a more technical job that will allow me to use the skills I am learning in school in tandem with all the soft skills I developed on this work term. In the I could not have asked for a better first work term, that resulted in a guaranteed part-time job while I study at the University of Guelph. </p>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Job Description</h2>
          <p>TPS monitors and responds to problem tickets created by first level Help Desk support, internal teams, and self-serve tickets created by employees. The tickets are sent to two separate queue, an unassigned tickets queue, and a self serve ticket queue. These tickets include hardware and software problems reported by a large group of users across multiple geographic locations. My main job as a Technical Support Analyst was to take incidents are resolve them. This meant performing basic troubleshooting, diagnosis, and root-cause analysis, to figure out how to solve a ticket. Since, users submitted tickets from various geographical locations, this required the TPS team members to work in shifts. The shifts spanned a week, and were divided in to 4 types of shifts; early shift (7:00 AM – 3:30 PM), late Shift (9:00 AM – 5:30 PM and 9:30 AM – 6:00 PM), regular shift (8:30 AM – 5:00 PM), self-serve shift (8:00 AM – 4:30 PM). Each shift had specified responsibilities, that needed to be completed while you were working that shift.<br><br>TPS had a knowledge bases full of articles that provided instructions on common issue/errors and articles around Co-operators polices. Another aspect of the jab was helping maintain this knowledge bases. By constantly attaching knowledge articles to tickets, and creating and maintaining knowledge articles for new and existing known errors utilizing standard enterprise tools and processes. Since, I was a co-op student, I didn’t have to learn how to approve knowledge articles when they were submitted by other team members.<br><br>While I was there, I was asked to create an application that would automate the creation of a virus report.

            My job revolved around resolving tickets, hence my main goal on this co-op term was to be a top ticket taker. When I started at the job there was a lot to learn and familiarize myself with. This meant there were certain tickets I struggled with, since the issue the users was having focused on areas I didn’t have experience in. But I tried to take a variety of tickets, to force my self to learn about the software’s the Co-operators employees were using and to familiarize myself with how to handle hardware issues. Doing this helped expose me to the team’s knowledges bases, where I was able to find documentation that helped guide me through solving tickets. The first two months on the job, I got into a pattern and figured out the best way for me to take and solve tickets. Then by my third month on the job I was able to meet my goal and become the top ticket taker on the team. By the end of my work term, I had taken the most tickets during my four months on the team. Taking so many tickets, improved my time management and multitasking skills, as I had to juggle up to 20 tickets a day. <br><br>Another goal I had on this work term was getting better at finding out what the client's problem is, and what might be causing it. Since the clients did not have technical knowledge, they didn't explain their problem using the correct terminology and rarely provided enough information, so I had to get better at reading between the lines. I did this by first figuring out what product was causing the client issues, and if any knowledge or past tickets existed to help start the troubleshooting process. If past information wasn't enough to solve the clients issue, I gathered more information on the clients issue and asked my mentor/the Team for help or I some research for a potential solution.<br><br>This goal truly tested me as this is was a constant occurrence with self-serve tickets coming in. Generally, our clients don't know what they are talking about and therefore entails a lot of information gathering to really find out what they need to resolve their issue. I have become much better at this and no longer even hesitate to ask for help from my coworkers. Furthermore, this was a skill worth improving because I will be working with users who don't have the same technical knowledge as me.

                <p>For my last co-op term I was working at my previous co-op employer; The Co-operators. But, I was working on a new team called Enterprise Service Management (ESM). This team was in charge of managing and maintaining the Co-operators usage of Service Now. The company mainly used service now to do the following Incident Management, Change Management, Request Fulfillment (request items such as software, access to services, etc), Agile Storyboarding, Dashboards, and various other company specialized modules. <br><br>
                ESM maintained Service Now using Agile Development where we had daily deploy(s) through Monday to Thursday. Work was done through stories created by a process owner(s), picked up by a developer and tested by a BSA (business system analyst). From Monday to Thursday the team had daily scrums, and there were additional scrums to attend if you were working on a project. Members of my team worked from different locations such as Regina, South Africa, Guelph, add Switzerland. Due to this, I was allowed to work from home frequently, this made life a lot easier as I would no longer need to commute from Brampton to Guelph.<br><br>
                While on the team I was invited to work trip to the Co-operators Regina office. This trip was 3 nights and 4 days (Monday - Thursday)  long and mainly used as a team-building event. We spent the first-day doing Agile training where a company called Pink Elephant came in and provided gamified training. This was a very cool experience, as everyone on the team was given roles that are not their daily roles. This forced people to experience someone else's job while learning more about the Agile Manifesto. It was interesting to see how our team already used the things we were being taught. The second day was devoted to team meetings and project meetings. The last day involved a team-building event, which was a cooking class and axe throwing. Overall the trip was a great way to interact with team members I don't typically engage with.

          <h2 class="mb-5">Job Description</h2>
          <p>
            Service Now releases 1-2 platform upgrades a year, to remain up to date, the Co-operators upgrade their instance of service now as new upgrades are released. When upgrading to the latest release of service now one of their environments will get upgraded, so system testing can be done to verify that upgrading to the new platform with not break anything. This upgrade in the past has taken 4 - 6 weeks. To speed up this process, service now released the automated testing framework (ATF) to help automate the manual testing process. My job mainly focused on working with ATF.<br><br>
            When I started I had prior experience using service now due to my job as a second level support analyst. But I did not have any experience with developing in service now or with ATF because of this my first couple of months involved a lot of learning. This process was made worse due to upgrading our instance of service now to the London Platform. During the platform upgrade, I was in charge of ATF, the upgrade had broken about 80 ATF tests. I had to quickly learn what these ATF tests were testing, how they were designed, and what was causing the failures. In the process of fixing tests, I was able to get a great handle on the ins and out of ATF, how certain modules were setup, company workflows, and how the team operated. <br><br>
            After, the upgrade I moved on to creating new ATF tests for the Change Management Module and HR Request Fulfilment, while also maintaining the current test base. The maintenance part of ATF  involved making sure ATF nightly/weekly runs ran smoothly, fixing any broken ATF tests, upgrading ATF tests that were impacted by an enhancement request, providing reports on ATF nightly/weekly runs, and updating documentation. Another part of maintaining the ATF suite involved voicing ATF concerns to the ATF process owner. These concerns were with outdated tests, house cleaning the ATF testbed, as several tests were not being run as part of the ATF nightly/weekly runs, bringing up ATF defects, etc. <br><br>
            Another part of my job involved updating articles in the team's knowledge base, doing ATF presentations, creating an ATF dashboard, doing manual testing, code reviews, creating stories, covering for a BSA when on vacation and training new employees on ATF. Over the 8-month co-op term, I help trained 5 employees on how to use ATF.  Due to the knowledge gained over my co-op term, the entire team comes to me when a question arises regarding ATF. At the end of my co-op, I know the co-operators ATF suite inside out.

          <h2 class="mb-5">Goals</h2>
            <p>
              In service now the cooperators offer several different modules to the business. My initial goal was to familiarize myself with the different modules the Co-operators service now instance offers, and put special focus on learning the Automated Test Framework (ATF) module. I did this by learning service now’s developing and admin roles from the udemy training courses I did. Then after finish the course, I started doing manual testing in service now by following the manual scripts created by BSA for various service now modules (ex. Defect, Incident, Knowledge, Change Management Request Fulfilment, etc). Once I had familiarized myself with the service now I moved on to fixing broken ATF tests, this required me to read service now ATF knowledge and previous knowledge left by prior co-op students. By my third month on the job, I knew I had achieved this goal as I was able to quickly fix broken ATF tests, could create complex ATF tests, and other team member started to asking me ATF questions.<br><br>
              When upgrading service now, my team relies on ATF test to make the upgrade process more efficient, as it automates the testing process. My second goal was to create more ATF tests, focusing on the CHG, and HR modules. For the change module, I worked closely with Janet a senior BSA who had written the stories to create ATF for the change module. Initially, there were 9 stories, when I started creating the test I would demo my finished test to Janet who would make sure my test design accurately tested the change module. As I finished the existing stories she created additional stories to continue testing. By the end of my co-op, I had finished 80% of ATF tests for the change module. For the HR ATF test creation, I was the lead BSA, so I created stories and made all critical ATF decision. When I finished an ATF test, I demoed it to another ATF developer and HR member on our team. By the end of my co-op, I had finished 90% of the needed ATF test creation. The remaining 10 % couldn’t be done as certain areas of HR were going through development. <br><br>
              When we updated Service now to the London upgrade, multiple ATF tests failed. These tests were failing due to all sorts of reasons, but mainly errors in user table query and hardcoded values. My last goal was to look through the ATF test suite and evaluate areas that need fixing. To achieve this goal, I had to bring to attention the issues with ATF tests, and how we should approach fixing them. When I started there were no set standards on how a test should be named, how record queries should be approached, writing specialized javascript for a test, etc. I started by creating some standards, and having the team start using them. Then I analysis what test exited but weren’t being run as part of an ATF schedule, or were sitting as inactive. After doing that anaylsis I cleaned the ATF test suite, and created a process to handle inactive tests. Lastly, I came up with a list of retrofitting areas. These were areas of the testing suite that needed fixing in several tests. For example, renaming the ATF tests, updating the test to use the portal frontend instead of the backend, etc. Every identified area had an analysis story created to determine its impact and the work required to fix the issue.

            <p>
              This co-op term was awesome!! I got to work from home 3 days a week, sometimes more, got taken on a team trip to Regina, and was able to put into practice what I am learning in school. Moreover, they appreciated my work ethic so much I got hired part-time and can continue working this job while in school. I just want to give a special shout out to Grant my manager, I really appreciated our one on ones, it was a really independent style of managing it allowed me to do great work. Another shout out to Janet, for being so helpful in getting me accustomed to the team.
